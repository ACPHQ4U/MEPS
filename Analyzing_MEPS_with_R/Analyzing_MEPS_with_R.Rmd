#  Loading MEPS Data

To load MEPS data, we will use the foreign package, which allows R to read SAS transport files. The `install.packages` function only needs to be run once (to download the package from the internet and store it on your computer). Typically, this is done with the command `install.packages("foreign")`.  The `library` function needs to be run every time you re-start your R session.


```{r eval = FALSE}
 install.packages("foreign")  # Only need to run this once
 library(foreign)             # Run this every time you re-start R
```

## Option 1.  Download SAS transport file to computer
1. Download and extract the SAS transport format zip file into 'C:/MEPS/SASDATA'
\
![](images/Option1_Fig2.png)
\
2. Use **read.xport** function to load file
\
```{r eval=FALSE}
FYC2013 = read.xport("C:/MEPS/SASDATA/h163.ssp")
```
## Option 2. Load data directly from website
1. Use **download.file** function to save zip file from MEPS website to temporary file **temp** (Hint: get file location by right-clicking ZIP link on website, then click 'Copy link address')
2. Use **unzip** and **read.xport** to unzip and load SAS transport data.
\
```{r eval = FALSE}  
download.file("https://meps.ahrq.gov/mepsweb/data_files/pufs/h163ssp.zip",
              temp <- tempfile())
    
unzipped_file = unzip(temp)

FYC2013 = read.xport(unzipped_file)
    
unlink(temp) # Unlink to delete temporary file
```


#  Survey Package

## Install and load **survey** package

```{r eval = FALSE}    
  install.packages("survey")
  library(survey)
``` 


```{r echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
# load fake data  -- this was for editing purposes to save time
 library(survey)
 library(foreign)
 load("C:/MEPS/FYC2013.RData")
 #save(FYC2013,file = "C:/MEPS/FYC2013.RData")
```

Functions available in **survey** package

* *svytotal*: population totals
* *svymean*: proportions and means
* *svyquantile*: quantiles (e.g. median)
* *svyratio*: ratio statistics (e.g. percentage of total expenditures)
* *svyglm*: generalized linear regression
* *svyby*: run other survey functions by group
  
## Define survey design object
```{r}  
mepsdsgn = svydesign(id = ~VARPSU, 
                     strata = ~VARSTR, 
                     weights = ~PERWT13F, 
                     data = FYC2013, 
                     nest=TRUE)  
```



# Expenses per person, by source of payment


[(TABLE 1)](https://meps.ahrq.gov/mepsweb/data_stats/tables_compendia_hh_interactive.jsp?_SERVICE=MEPSSocket0&_PROGRAM=MEPSPGM.TC.SAS&File=HCFY2013&Table=HCFY2013_PLEXP_%40&VAR1=AGE&VAR2=SEX&VAR3=RACETH5C&VAR4=INSURCOV&VAR5=POVCAT13&VAR6=REGION&VAR7=HEALTH&VARO1=4+17+44+64&VARO2=1&VARO3=1&VARO4=1&VARO5=1&VARO6=1&VARO7=1&_Debug=): 

## Total population
Total population = sum of survey weights (PERWT13F). We don't need to use a **svy** function here, since standard errors are not applicable to population control totals.
```{r}
sum(FYC2013$PERWT13F) 
```

## Total expenses
To use the **svytotal** function, we can use the '$' notation to indicate that we want to use dataset FYC2013 and variable TOTEXP13.
```{r error=TRUE}
svytotal(FYC2013$TOTEXP13, design = mepsdsgn)  
```
Or we can use the formula notation '~', to tell R that we want to look in the design object **mepsdsgn** (in which we defined dataset FYC2013) to find the variable TOTEXP13.
```{r}
svytotal(~TOTEXP13,design = mepsdsgn)  
```
  
## Percent with expense

To calculate the percent of people with any expense, first create a new indicator variable for persons with an expense.
```{r error = TRUE} 
FYC2013$any_expense = (FYC2013$TOTEXP13 > 0)*1

head(FYC2013$any_expense) 
```
But, when we try to run **svymean**, we get an error, since we added a variable to the dataset *after* defining the survey design object, **mepsdsgn**. 
```{r error=TRUE}
svymean(~any_expense, design = mepsdsgn) 
```

We need to re-run the code defining **mepsdsgn** to include the dataset with the new variable.
```{r error=TRUE}
mepsdsgn = svydesign(id = ~VARPSU, 
                     strata = ~VARSTR, 
                     weights = ~PERWT13F, 
                     data = FYC2013, 
                     nest=TRUE)
```
Now **svymean** will work, since the **mepsdsgn** object now includes the version of the dataset that contains the new variable **any_expense**
```{r}
svymean(~any_expense,design = mepsdsgn) 
```

## Mean and median, per person with an expense

To get expenses per person with an expense, we want to limit the dataset to persons that have an expense (i.e. any_expense == 1), using the **subset** function.

```{r}
#mean
svymean(~TOTEXP13, design = subset(mepsdsgn,any_expense==1)) 

#median
svyquantile(~TOTEXP13, design = subset(mepsdsgn,any_expense==1),quantiles = 0.5) 
```
    
## Distribution of expenses by source of payment
For percent of total, we need to use the **svyratio** function, and specify the numerator and denominator. First, we'll estimate the percent for out-of-pocket payments (TOTSLF13).    
```{r error=TRUE}    
svyratio(~TOTSLF13, denominator = ~TOTEXP13, design = mepsdsgn)
```

We can also calculate percentages for multiple variables at one time, using a '+' sign in the formula notation.
```{r error = TRUE}
svyratio(~TOTSLF13 + TOTPTR13 + TOTMCR13 + TOTMCD13, 
    denominator = ~TOTEXP13, 
    design = mepsdsgn)
```
Before estimating percentages for 'Other' insurance, we need to adjust this variable to match the online table: Other = VA + worker's comp + other sources.

Previously, we did this by adding new variables to the dataset FYC2013, and then re-defining the design object **mepsdsgn**. But, we can streamline this process by using the **update** function to make changes to **mepsdsgn** directly, without changing the dataset FYC2013.
```{r}
mepsdsgn <- update(mepsdsgn, tototh13 = TOTVA13 + TOTWCP13 + TOTOTH13)
```

```{r}
svyratio(~tototh13, denominator = ~TOTEXP13, design = mepsdsgn)
```

# Percent distribution by type of service 

[(STAT BRIEF #491)](https://meps.ahrq.gov/data_files/publications/st491/stat491.shtml)

Now we will re-create the data table for Figure 1 in Stat brief #491: "National Health Care Expenses in the U.S. Civilian Noninstitutionalized Population, Distributions by Type of Service and Source of Payment, 2013" by Marie Stagnitti.


To get ambulatory (OB+OP) and home health/other expenditures, we need to add variables to the **mepsdsgn** object.

```{r error=TRUE}
  mepsdsgn <- update(mepsdsgn, 
                     ambexp13 = OBVEXP13 + OPTEXP13 + ERTEXP13,
                     hhexp13  = HHAEXP13 + HHNEXP13 + VISEXP13 + OTHEXP13)
```

Up until now, we've been running survey functions to estimate means, totals, etc., but we've only been printing that information to the R console, rather than storing those estimates. 

Here, we create the variable **pct_TOS** to store the estimates from the **svyratio** function, which is calculating the percentage distribution of expenditures by type of service.

```{r error = TRUE}
pct_TOS = svyratio(~IPTEXP13 + ambexp13 + RXEXP13 + DVTEXP13 + hhexp13, 
                     denominator = ~TOTEXP13, 
                     design = mepsdsgn)
```

Because we are storing estimates in the variable **pct_TOS**, we have to ask R to specifically print the results if we want to view them.
```{r}
print(pct_TOS)
```

Now we can do the same thing by age group (< 65, and 65+), using the **subset** function.
```{r error = TRUE}
pct_TOS_lt65 = svyratio(~IPTEXP13 + ambexp13 + RXEXP13 + DVTEXP13 + hhexp13, 
                        denominator = ~TOTEXP13, 
                        design = subset(mepsdsgn,AGELAST < 65))
  
pct_TOS_ge65 = svyratio(~IPTEXP13 + ambexp13 + RXEXP13 + DVTEXP13 + hhexp13, 
                        denominator = ~TOTEXP13, 
                        design = subset(mepsdsgn,AGELAST >= 65))
```


Now we want to extract the coefficient estimates and combine them into a table. To do that, we can use the function **coef** to get the coefficients from the **svyratio** results, and then combine them into a matrix using **cbind**.
```{r error = TRUE}
pct_matrix = cbind(coef(pct_TOS),
                   coef(pct_TOS_lt65),
                   coef(pct_TOS_ge65))*100
print(pct_matrix)
```
 
To clean it up a bit, we can change the row and column names: 
```{r error = TRUE} 
rownames(pct_matrix) = c("Hospital IP",
                        "Ambulatory",
                        "RX",
                        "Dental",
                        "HH and Other")
 
colnames(pct_matrix) = c("Total","<65 years","65+ years")
  
print(pct_matrix)
```

## Export table to Excel (csv file)

If we are happy with our table, now we can export it to a .csv file, to make a barchart in excel.
```{r error = TRUE}
write.csv(pct_matrix,file = "C:/MEPS/figure1.csv")
```
  
## Create a barplot in R

Alternatively, we can make a bar chart in R instead!

The default for the function **barplot** is to create a stacked bar plot if we give it a matrix, where each bar represents a column.

```{r error = TRUE}
  barplot(pct_matrix) 
```

In order to switch the bar chart, so that the bars are type of service, not age group, we can use the transpose function **t** to pivot the matrix  
```{r}
print(t(pct_matrix))
barplot(t(pct_matrix)) 
```

To change the bars to be side by side, use the 'beside = TRUE' option
```{r}
barplot(t(pct_matrix), beside = TRUE) 
```

We can also specify colors for the pars, add a label to the y-axis, add a legend, and add data labels on top of the bars.
```{r error=TRUE}
bp <- barplot(t(pct_matrix),beside=TRUE,
                col = c("blue","yellow","magenta"),
                ylab = "Percentage",
                legend=T)

text(x = bp, y = t(pct_matrix)+2,
     labels = round(t(pct_matrix)),
     xpd=T,col="blue",font=2)
```



# Saving your data

We've done all of this hard work to load in the MEPS files and calculate estimates, so how can we save it to use next time?

We can just save a single item, for instance, the MEPS FYC 2013 data
```{r eval = FALSE}
save(FYC2013,file = "C:/MEPS/SASDATA/PUF_h163.RData")
```

Or we can save multiple items, like **pct_matrix** and the **mepsdsgn** object.
```{r eval = FALSE}
save(mepsdsgn,pct_matrix,file = "C:/MEPS/SASDATA/PUF_and_table.RData")
```


Once the .Rdata file is saved, it can be re-loaded in a new R session using the following code:
```{r eval = FALSE}
load(file = "C:/MEPS/SASDATA/PUF_h163.RData")
```


# Bonus Material

## svyby
The **svyby** function can be used to calculate estimates for all levels of a subgroup. For instance, previously we calculated the percent distribution of expenditures by type of service separately for persons aged 65 and older and those under age 65, by using the **subset** function.

```{r error = TRUE}
svyratio(~IPTEXP13+ambexp13, 
              denominator = ~TOTEXP13, 
              design = subset(mepsdsgn,AGELAST >= 65))
```

However, we can also get estimates for persons 65+ and <65 simulataneously by using the **svyby** function. This function works with other svy functions (e.g. **svymean**, **svytotal**, **svyratio**) using the **FUN = ** option.
```{r error = TRUE}
svyby(~IPTEXP13+ambexp13, 
        denominator = ~TOTEXP13, 
        by = ~(AGELAST >= 65),
        design = mepsdsgn,
        FUN = svyratio)
```

            colour = rgb(0,0,173,maxColorValue = 255),
            fontface = "bold")+
  theme_classic()+
  theme(legend.position="top",
        legend.title = element_blank(),
        axis.line.x = element_line(colour="black"),
        axis.line.y = element_line(colour="black"),
        text = element_text(colour=rgb(0,0,173,maxColorValue = 255),
                            face="bold"))+
  scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0,0),limits=c(0,max(long$value)+2))
