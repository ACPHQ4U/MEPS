# MEPS Workshops

The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) conducts several workshops throughout the year. These workshops provide extended knowledge about MEPS data, practical information about usage of MEPS public use data files and an opportunity to construct analytic files with the assistance of AHRQ staff. The workshops are designed for health services researchers who have a background or interest in using national health surveys. For questions regarding MEPS Workshop, please contact Anita Soni at [WorkshopInfo@ahrq.hhs.gov](WorkshopInfo@ahrq.hhs.gov).
