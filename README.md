# Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS)

MEPS is a set of large-scale surveys of families and individuals and their medical providers, and employers across the United States, conducted annually since 1996. MEPS is the only national data source that measures how Americans use and pay for medical care, health insurance, and out-of-pocket spending. Annual surveys of individuals and families, as well as their health care providers, provide data on health status, the use of medical services, charges, insurance coverage, and satisfaction with care. More information on each component is provided below.

## MEPS-HC
The <b>MEPS Household Component (MEPS-HC)</b> survey collects information from families and individuals that provides timely, comprehensive information on the health status of Americans, health insurance coverage, and access, use, and cost of health services. The MEPS-HC includes information on medical expenditures, conditions, and events; demographics (for example, age, ethnicity, and income); health insurance coverage; access to care; health status; and jobs held. Each surveyed household is interviewed five times over a two-year period. These data are [available to the public](https://meps.ahrq.gov/mepsweb/data_stats/download_data_files.jsp).

## Additional Survey Components
MEPS is comprised of two additional components: The <b>MEPS Medical Provider Component (MEPS-MPC)</b> and the <b>MEPS Insurance Component (MEPS-IC)</b>. The MEPS-MPC survey collects information from providers of medical care that supplements the information collected from persons in the MEPS-HC sample in order to provide the most accurate cost data possible. The MEPS-IC survey collects information from employers in the private sector and state and local governments on the health insurance coverage offered to their employees.  Includes information on the number and types of private health insurance plans offered, benefits associated with these plans, annual premiums and contributions to premiums by employers and employees, copayments and coinsurance, by various employer characteristics (for example, State, industry and firm size). 

These datasets are not available to the public. Access to the MEPS-MPC data can be requested from the [AHRQ data center](https://meps.ahrq.gov/mepsweb/data_stats/onsite_datacenter.jsp).
